      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I'm just a normal student attending Seneca College. In my spare time I like to play
          computer games and use streaming services such as YouTube and Netflix.
          Currently some of my favourite shows are "S.W.A.T" and "Chicago Fire." I
          hope soon that Netflix will upload more seasons of those shows on their platform.

      <p>I think overall, my experience in the WEB222 has been pretty alright. Unfortunately, I struggled
           with the last two assignments before this final exam. However, that is on me; I should’ve made 
           sure to review some important concepts, but I also should’ve made sure I had enough time to 
           finish them. Procrastination will bite you if you aren’t too careful. I believe the other 
           assignments, including this one and the quizzes, were done okay. They could’ve been better, 
           but it is what it is at this point. Attending this course, I learned some critical topics 
           regarding the principles of web programming. Firstly, I learned things about JavaScript and 
           JavaScript functions during the beginning parts of this course. Then in the next few weeks, 
           I watched online lectures discussing HTML. Stuff like document structures, elements, all sorts 
           of media, and how to work with all of those things. After that, a few sessions were dedicated 
           to learning how to make our websites look pleasant through the topics of CSS. More things were 
           discussed in-depth throughout this semester, but everything felt pretty lovely overall. If I 
           ever wanted to focus more on web development or quickly needed to make some web pages, while 
           I think there is still a lot more for me to learn about to work efficiently, all of the 
           concepts I learned should help me in that department. This course wasn’t bad. It was pretty enjoyable.</p>
